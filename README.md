# 📚 Nalanda Library Management System

## Overview

The **Nalanda Library Management System** is a backend project designed to manage a library's operations, such as user management, book management, borrowing system, and generating reports. This system offers RESTful APIs to perform the necessary operations.

The system is built using **Node.js, Express,** and **MongoDB**, and includes JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. The project also utilizes the MongoDB aggregation framework to generate reports.
